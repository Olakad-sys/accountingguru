  <h2>Adjusting and Closing Entries</h2>
  <p>Adjusting entries update balances for accruals, prepaid items, and depreciation before financial statements. Closing entries reset temporary accounts (like revenue and expense) to zero at period end.</p>

  <h4>Example — Depreciation</h4>
  <p>Machine bought R12,000, useful life 4 years → annual depreciation R3,000. Adjusting entry: Debit Depreciation Expense R3,000 | Credit Accumulated Depreciation R3,000.</p>

  <h4>Try it — Exercise</h4>
  <p>Q: You received insurance paid in advance R1,200 for 12 months. After one month, how much is expense and what entry?</p>
  <details><summary>Answer</summary><p>Monthly expense R100. Debit Insurance Expense R100 | Credit Prepaid Insurance R100.</p></details>
