  <h2>Financial Statements</h2>
  <p>There are three main reports: Income Statement, Balance Sheet, and Cash Flow Statement.</p>

  <h4>Income Statement</h4>
  <p>Shows revenues and expenses for a period → calculates profit or loss.</p>
  <p><strong>Example:</strong> Sales R10,000 - Expenses R6,000 = Net profit R4,000.</p>

  <h4>Balance Sheet</h4>
  <p>Shows what the business owns (assets) and owes (liabilities) at a point in time. Assets = Liabilities + Equity.</p>

  <h4>Cash Flow Statement</h4>
  <p>Shows how cash moved in and out (operating, investing, financing).</p>
