  <h2>Introduction to Accounting</h2>
  <p>Accounting is the process of recording, organizing, and summarizing money-related events so people can make good decisions. Businesses use accounting to know if they made profit, how much they owe, and how much they own.</p>
  <h4>Why it matters (simple):</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Owners check profit or loss.</li>
    <li>Banks decide to lend based on financial info.</li>
    <li>Managers plan budgets and control costs.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Example</h4>
  <p>If you sell stationery for R100 cash, you record that R100 came in and revenue increased by R100.</p>

  <h4>Try it — Exercise</h4>
  <p>Q: If you buy a laptop for R8,000 in cash for the business, what happened?</p>
  <details>
    <summary>Answer</summary>
    <p>You received an asset (Laptop +R8,000) and paid out cash (Cash -R8,000). Total equity doesn't change.</p>
